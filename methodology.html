    <p>To our readership,</p><br><p>

      Welcome to The Daily Princetonian’s inaugural Senior Survey. Our team has spent months diligently analyzing 
      responses from over 500 seniors, seeking to tell the story of the Great Class of 2022. 
    </p><br><p>
      As you browse through 200 charts and graphs, compiled from over 60,000 data points, we ask that you take a 
      moment to recognize the gravity of each visualization. Every bar, column, and pie represents the experiences 
      and opinions of hundreds of students, powerfully shaped by their time at Old Nassau.
    </p><br><p>
      Many of the statistics within this project represent information to which the wider University community
       has never been privy. In some sense, these pages illustrate the most comprehensive portrait ever assembled 
       for a graduating Princeton class.
      </p><br><p></p>
      Our survey was conducted over a period of 15 days, from March 14 to March 29, 2022. On several occasions, 
      The Daily Princetonian emailed a Google Form to all members of the Class of 2022 included in the Residential 
      College Student Facebook as of March 11 — a total of 1,247 people. 516 students responded, comprising 41.4 
      percent of the class.
    </p><br><p>
      Every question on the survey was optional. On select sensitive inquiries, respondents could explicitly decline 
      to answer. Although all replies were fully anonymous, the Google Form was limited to individuals with a 
      University-issued email address (@princeton.edu), and a feature from Google enabled the ‘Prince’ to prevent 
      multiple submissions. 
    </p><br><p>
      To protect respondents’ anonymity, only select members of our data team accessed the raw numbers, and none 
      made any effort to identify individual seniors. Further, we collected and aggregated all personal data on 
      Google accounts unaffiliated with the University.
    </p><br><p>
      Our team exercised discretion when presenting the data, carefully examining the implications of various 
      tabulations and striving to ensure privacy at every juncture. As all of our queries were optional, many 
      questions garnered sample sizes one to two percent smaller than the overall respondent pool. In our 
      narratives, “respondent,” “senior,” “student,” or any comparable phrase refers to those who answered a 
      given question.
    </p><br><p>
      We did not calculate the significance test results of data points drawing from two or more questions, nor 
      did we make any attempt to alter the weight of various demographic cohorts to more accurately match the 
      complete class of 2022. 
    </p><br><p>
      Thank you for taking the time to read, consider, and interrogate our work. The Senior Survey is meant to 
      serve as a collaborative reflection, initiating dialogue for the greater Princeton community while 
      preserving the stories of this consummately unique class. We also hope that it is, and continues to be, a 
      whole lot of fun.
    </p><br><p>  
      Cheers,
    </p><br><p>
      Sam Kagan ’24 and Caroline di Vittorio ’22
      </p>
